This notes is copied from the third section of \cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms}. Most of all the details have been well presented in that paper, hence I only record some ideas of the proofs. 

We fix a prime number $p$, and all the algebras we concern are over $\bb{Z}_{(p)}$.

\section{The Category of Prisms}
\begin{mylem}[\cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 3.1]\label{lem:indzar-dist}
	Given a pair $(A,I)$, where $A$ is a $\delta$-ring and $I$ is a locally principal ideal of $A$, denote by $\phi$ the associated lifting of Frobenius of $A/p$. Assume that $p$ and $I$ lie in $\text{rad}(A)$, then the followings are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $p\in I^p+\phi(I)A$;
		\item $p\in I+\phi(I)A$;
		\item There exists a faithfully flat ind-Zariski localization $A\to A'$, such that $IA'$ is generated by a distinguished element $d$, and $d,p\in\text{rad}(A')$.
	\end{enumerate}
If we remove the assumption ``$p$ and $I$ lie in $\text{rad}(A)$'', then the same conclusions hold except that the map $A\to A'$ in (3) is only flat.
\end{mylem}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
	$(1)\Rightarrow (2)$ is trivial.\\
	For $(2)\Rightarrow (3)$, take principal open subsets of $A$, over which $I$ is principal. Then take the Zariski localization $A'$ along the closed subset $V(p,I)$, which contains all the maximal ideals of $A$ (see \cite{stacks-project} \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0975}{0975}). $A'$ is flat over $A$, since ind-Zariski localization is flat. $A'$ is indeed faithfully flat over $A$, since $p$ and $I$ lie in $\text{rad}(A)$ and generalizations lift along a flat morphism (see \cite{stacks-project} \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00HS}{00HS}). Also we have $IA'$ is generated by an element $d$ by construction, and $d$ is distinguished because condition (2) holds and $d,p\in \text{rad}(A')$ (see \cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 2.25).\\
	For $(3)\Rightarrow (1)$, it suffices to show that $p=0$ in $A'/(d^p,\phi(d))$. But this follows directly as $d$ is distinguished.
\end{proof}

\begin{mydefn}[\cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Definition 3.2]\label{defn:prism}
	A \tbf{prism} is a pair $(A,I)$, where $A$ is a $\delta$-ring and $I\subseteq A$ defines a Cartier divisor on $\spec A$ (i.e. $I$ is locally generated by a nonzero divisor), such that $A$ is derived $(p,I)$-complete, and $p\in I+\phi(I)A$  \textcolor{red}{(I don't know whether we have $(p,I)\subseteq \text{rad}(A)$)}.
	
	A prism is called \tbf{perfect} if the Frobenius lifting $\phi:A\to A$ is an isomorphism; a prism is called \tbf{bounded} if $A/I$ has bounded $p^\infty$-torsion.
	
	A morphism $(A,I)\to (B,J)$ of prisms is a $\delta$-ring map $A\to B$ carrying $I$ into $J$. It is called \tbf{(faithfully) flat} if $A\to B$ is $(p,I)$-completely (faithfully) flat.
\end{mydefn}

\begin{mylem}[\cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 3.5]\label{lem:rigidity-prism}
	\mbox{}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Given a morphism $(A,I)\to (B,J)$ of prisms, then $I\otimes_A B\to J$ is an isomorphism. In particular, $J=IB$.
		\item Given a prism $(A,I)$ and a $\delta$-$A$-algebra $B$ being derived $(p,I)$-complete. Then $(B,IB)$ is a prism if and only if $B[I]=0$ ($B[I]=\op{Tor}_1^A(B,A/I)$ by definition).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{mylem}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
	(1): Since $I\otimes_AB$ and $J$ are invertible $B$-modules, hence it suffices to show that $I\otimes_A B\to J$ is surjective, hence it suffices to check that the diagram
	\begin{align*}
	\xymatrix{
		A\ar[r]\ar[d] & A/I\ar[d]\\
		B\ar[r] & B/J
	}
	\end{align*}
	is a pushout diagram, which can be checked after taking Zariski localizations of $A$ and $B$ along $V(p,I)$. By lemma \ref{lem:indzar-dist}, we may assume that $I=(d)$, $J=(e)$, $d,e$ are distinguished and $(p,d)\subseteq \text{rad}(A),(p,e)\subseteq \text{rad}(B)$. Write $d=ef$, thus $f$ is a unit by \cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 2.24, which completes our proof.
	
	(2): Notice that $B[I]=0$ if and only if $IB=I\otimes_AB$, which implies that $IB$ is a Cartier divisor, thus $(B,IB)$ is a prism. Conversely, $(B,IB)$ being a prism implies that $IB=I\otimes_A B$ as above.
\end{proof}

\begin{mylem}[\cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 3.6]\label{lem:frobpullback-div}
	Given a prism $(A,I)$, then $\phi^*(I)=I\otimes_{A,\phi} A$ and $I^p$ are trivial invertible $A$-modules, and any generator of $\phi(I)A$ is distinguished.
\end{mylem}



\section{Bounded Prisms}
\begin{mylem}[\cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 3.7]\label{lem:boundedprism}
	Given a bounded prism $(A,I)$, then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $A$ is classically $(p,I)$-complete. In particular, $(p,I)\subseteq \text{rad}(A)$.
		\item For any $A$-complex $M\in D(A)$ being $(p,I)$-derived complete and $(p,I)$-completely flat, then $M$ is discrete and classically $(p,I)$-complete. Moreover, for any $n>0$, $M[I^n]=0$, $M/I^nM$ has bounded $p^\infty$-torsion.
		\item The category of (faithfully) flat $(A,I)$-prisms is equivalent to the category of $(p,I)$-derived complete and $(p,I)$-completely (faithfully) flat $\delta$-$A$-algebras, by the functor sending $(B,IB)$ to $B$.
		\item There is a $(p,I)$-completely faithfully flat $(A,I)$-prism $(B,IB)$ such that $IB=(d)$ where $d$ is distinguished.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{mylem}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
	(1): we have the following sequence of isomorphisms:
	\begin{align*}
	A\cong& R\lim_n R\lim_m \op{Kos}(A;I^n,p^m)\\
	\cong & R\lim_n R\lim_m \op{Kos}(A/I^n;p^m)\\
	\cong & R\lim_n R\lim_m A/(I^n,p^m)\\
	\cong & \lim_n A/(p,I)^n
	\end{align*}
	where the first equality comes from derived $(p,I)$-completeness of $A$, the second from the fact that $I^n$ is locally generated by a nonzero divisor, the third by virtue of $A/I^n$ having bounded $p^\infty$-torsion (by devissage from $n=1$) and applying \cite{mohamed-derived} Lemma 1.8, and the last by Mittag-Leffler.
	
	(2): Note that $M\otimes_A^L A/I^n$ is still $(p,I)$-derived complete and $(p,I)$-completely flat. Since (by devissage) $A/I^n$ having bounded $p^\infty$-torsion, apply \cite{mohamed-derived} Lemma 2.5 and we know that $M\otimes_A^L A/I^n$ is discrete ($=M/I^nM$, thus $M[I^n]=0$) and has bounded $p^\infty$-torsion. 
	Then we have the following sequence of isomorphisms:
	\begin{align*}
	M\cong& R\lim_n M\otimes^L_A \op{Kos}(A;I^n)\\
	\cong & R\lim_n M\otimes_A^L A/I^n\\
	\cong & R\lim_n M/I^nM\\
	\cong & \lim_n M/I^nM
	\end{align*}
	where the first equality comes from derived $I$-completeness of $M$, the second from the fact that $I^n$ is locally generated by a nonzero divisor, the third by virtue of the discreteness of $M\otimes_A^L A/I^n$, and the last by Mittag-Leffler. In particular, this shows that $M$ is discrete.
	 Similarly we then also have the following sequence of isomorphisms as in (1):
	\begin{align*}
	M\cong& R\lim_n R\lim_m M\otimes_A^L\op{Kos}(A;I^n,p^m)\\
	\cong & R\lim_n R\lim_m M\otimes_A^L\op{Kos}(A/I^n;p^m)\\
	\cong & R\lim_n R\lim_m M\otimes_A^L A/(I^n,p^m)\\
	\cong & R\lim_n R\lim_m M\otimes_A A/(I^n,p^m)\\
	\cong & \lim_n M/(p,I)^nM
	\end{align*}
	where the first equality comes from derived $(p,I)$-completeness of $M$, the second from the fact that $I^n$ is locally generated by a nonzero divisor, the third by virtue of $A/I^n$ having bounded $p^\infty$-torsion (by devissage from $n=1$) and applying \cite{mohamed-derived} Lemma 1.8, the forth follows the $(p,I)$-completely flatness of $M$, and the last by Mittag-Leffler and the discreteness of $M$.
	
	(3) obviously follows (2).
	
	(4): take $B$ to be the $(p,I)$-derived completion of the ring $A'$ from lemma \ref{lem:indzar-dist}. (2) implies that $(B,IB)$ defines a prism.
\end{proof}


\begin{mycor}[\cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Corollary 3.12]\label{cor:affprissite}
	The category opposite to all bounded prisms $(B,J)$ over a bounded prism $(A,I)$, endowed with faithfully flat coverings, forms a site. The functor that carries $(B,J)$ to $B$ (resp. $B/J$) forms a sheaf for this topology with vanishing higher cohomology on $(A,I)$.
\end{mycor}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
	To check the site axioms, it suffices to show that: given a diagram $(C,IC)\stackrel{c}{\leftarrow} (A,I)\stackrel{b}{\rightarrow} (B,IB)$ of maps of bounded prisms with $b$ faithfully flat, then $b$ admits a pushout along $c$ which is also faithfully flat. For this, we simply take $D$ to be the derived $(p,I)$-completion of $B\otimes_A^LC$. Since $B\otimes_A^LC$ is $(p,I)$-completely faithfully flat over $C$, $D$ is also $(p,I)$-completely faithfully flat over $C$ by \cite{mohamed-derived} Lemma 2.4. Lemma \ref{lem:boundedprism} (3) implies that $(D,ID)$ is a bounded prism over $(A,I)$ and it is clear by construction that it has the universal property.
	
	To check the sheaf axiom, it suffices to check the validity of faithfully flat descent in this category. Given a faithfully flat map $(A,I)\to (B,IB)$ of bounded prisms, the classical descent of the faithfully flat map $A\to B\otimes_A^LA/(p,I)^n=B/(p,I)^n$ gives us an exact sequence:
	\begin{align*}
	\xymatrix{
		0\ar[r]& A/(p,I)^n\ar[r]& B\otimes_A^LA/(p,I)^n\ar[r]& \left(B\otimes_A^LA/(p,I)^n\right)\otimes_A\left(B\otimes_A^LA/(p,I)^n\right)\ar[r]&\cdots
	}
	\end{align*}
	The flatness implies that $\left(B\otimes_A^LA/(p,I)^n\right)\otimes_A\left(B\otimes_A^LA/(p,I)^n\right)=\left(B\otimes_A^LA/(p,I)^n\right)\otimes_A^L\left(B\otimes_A^LA/(p,I)^n\right)=(B\otimes_A^LB)\otimes_A^LA/(p,I)^n=(B\otimes_A^LB)^\wedge\otimes_A^LA/(p,I)^n=(B\coprod_A B)\otimes_A^LA/(p,I)^n=(B\coprod_A B)\otimes_AA/(p,I)^n=B\coprod_A B/(p,I)^n$, where $B\coprod_A B$ is the pushout of $B$ along $A\to B$. In fact, we may write the exact sequence above as:
	\begin{align*}
	\xymatrix{
		0\ar[r]& A/(p,I)^n\ar[r]& B/(p,I)^n\ar[r]& \left(B\coprod_A B\right)/(p,I)^n\ar[r]&\left(B\coprod_A B\coprod_A B\right)/(p,I)^n\ar[r]&\cdots
	}
	\end{align*}
	Taking inverse limits and by Mittag-Leffler we get the faithfully flat descent in our category, i.e. the exact sequence
	\begin{align*}
	\xymatrix{
		0\ar[r]& A\ar[r]& B\ar[r]& B\coprod_A B\ar[r]&B\coprod_A B\coprod_A B\ar[r]&\cdots
	}
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}



\section{Perfect Prisms}
\begin{mylem}[\cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 3.8]\label{lem:perf-bounded}
	Given a perfect prism $(A,I)$, then $I$ is principal, any generator is distinguished, and $(A,I)$ is a bounded prism.
\end{mylem}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
	First, $A$ is a perfect $\delta$-ring thus is $p$-torsion free by \cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 2.28, hence $A$ is classically $p$-complete by \cite{mohamed-derived} Lemma 1.8. Lemma \ref{lem:frobpullback-div} says that $\phi^*(I)$ is a trivial invertible $A$-module. Since $\phi$ is an isomorphism by our assumption, $I$ is also a trivial invertible $A$-module, i.e. principal. Also each generator of $I$ is distinguished. Write $I=(d)$, then by \cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 2.34 we know that $A/d[p^\infty]=A/d[p]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{mydefn}[\cite{bhatt-pris} \Luoma{4} Definition 2.1]\label{defn:perfectoid}
	A commutative ring $R$ is called \tbf{perfectoid} if it has the form $A/I$ for a perfect prism $(A,I)$. The category of perfectoid rings is the full subcategory of all commutative rings spanned by perfectoid rings.
\end{mydefn}

\begin{mythm}[\cite{bhatt-pris} \Luoma{4} Theorem 2.3]\label{thm:perfectoid}
	The construction $(A,I)\mapsto A/I$ defines an equivalence of categories between perfect prisms and perfectoid rings.
\end{mythm}
\begin{proof}[Bhatt's proof]
	Let $(A,I)$ be a perfect prism with associated perfectoid ring $R$. We shall recover $(A,I)$ from $R$. Define $R^\flat=\plim_\phi R/p$ to be the inverse limit perfection of $R/p$. We shall show
	that $A\cong W(R^\flat)$. As both sides are perfect and $p$-adically complete $\delta$-rings, it is enough to show
	that $A/p\cong R^\flat$
	(\cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Corollary 2.31). Note that $R/p = A/(p,d)$. As $A/p$ is perfect, it is then easy to see that $R^\flat$ identifies with the classical $d$-adic completion of $A/p$: the $n$-fold Frobenius map
	$A/(p, d) → A/(p, d)$ identifies with the canonical map $A/(p, d^{p^n}) → A/(p, d)$ compatibly in $n$, so
	the inverse limit $\plim_\phi R/p$ identifies with the inverse limit $\plim_n A/(p, d^{p^n})$. It is thus enough to show that $A/p$ is classically $d$-complete, which follows from lemma \ref{lem:perf-bounded}.
	
	Next, we explain how to recover $I\subseteq A$ from $A=W(R^\flat)$ and $R$. By construction, we have
	a surjective map $R^\flat\to R$. By deformation theory (i.e. vanishing of the cotangent complex
	$L_{(A/p)/\bb{F}_p}$), this lifts uniquely to a map $A=W(R^\flat)\to R$. This map is surjective by derived
	Nakayama. By uniqueness, this map $A\to R$ must coincide with the original map $A\to A/I=R$
	as they agree modulo $p$. In particular, we can recover $I$ as the kernel of $A=W(R^\flat)\to R$.
\end{proof}

\begin{mylem}[\cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 3.9]\label{lem:perfofpris}
	Given any prism $(A,I)$, let $A_{\text{perf}}=\op{colim}_\phi A$ be the colimit perfection of $A$. Then $IA_{\text{perf}}=(d)$ is generated by a distinguished element $d$. $d,p$ are nonzero divisors in $A_{\text{perf}}$ and $A_{\text{perf}}/d[p^\infty]=A_{\text{perf}}/d$. In particular, the derived $(p,I)$-coompletion $A_\infty$ of $A_{\text{perf}}$ agrees with its classical $(p,I)$-completion, and $(A,I)_{\text{perf}}=(A_\infty,IA_\infty)$ is the universal perfect prism under $(A,I)$.
\end{mylem}
\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]
	Since $A\to \op{colim}_\phi A$ factors through $\phi:A\to A$ and $\phi(I)A$ is generated by a distinguished element (see lemma \ref{lem:frobpullback-div}), $IA_{\text{perf}}$ is also generated by a distinguished element. Since $A_{\text{perf}}$ is faithfully flat over $A$, $IA_{\text{perf}}=I\otimes_AA_{\text{perf}}$ is a Cartier divisor over $\spec A_{\text{perf}}$, in particular, $d$ is a nonzero divisor. Since $A_{\text{perf}}$ is a perfect $\delta$-ring, it is $p$-torsion free by \cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 2.28, i.e. $p$ is also a nonzero divisor. \cite{bhatt-scholze-prisms} Lemma 2.34 implies that $A_{\text{perf}}/d[p^\infty]=A_{\text{perf}}/d[p]$. By similar proof as in lemma \ref{lem:boundedprism}, we get $A_\infty=R\lim_n R\lim_m \op{Kos}(A_{\text{perf}};I^n,p^m)=\plim A_{\text{perf}}/(d,p)^n$. The universality follows directly the construction.
\end{proof}
